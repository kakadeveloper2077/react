⚛︎ React is a JS Library for UI Interfaces, with it we use .jsx file extension which is basically javascript mixed with html. <br> <br>
⚛︎ Every React Project has its own "Main.jsx", he is responsible for the render of the components and the other things, for each component which we create, at the final we use "export defualt (name of the component.)" to export and use at the "Main.jsx". <br> <br>
⚛︎ React has components, which is .jsx files separated what has javascript function returning html elemments, inside of it, we can use normal javascript variables on the html content, this apply for img resizing, and simple math calculations, this is known by interpolation.  <br> <br>
